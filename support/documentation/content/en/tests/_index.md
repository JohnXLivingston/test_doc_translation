## ESBuild vs Typescript

This plugin uses ESBuild for frontend code generation, as the official `peertube-plugin-quickstart` plugin.
ESBuild can handle Typescript, but does not check types (see [ESBuild documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript)).
That's why we first compile Typescript with the `-noEmit` option, just to check types (`check:client:ts` in package.json file).
Then, if everything is okay, we run ESBuild to generate the compiled javascript.

## Translations

The principal language is english (`en` code).

The different translations of the same file are side by side in the tree, and are identified by a language code in the file name extension.
Example: `_index.fr.md` is the French translation of `_index.en.md`.

Please note that a missing translation file will not appear in the menus of the generated site.

**Always make sure to create files for all languages**, even if the translation is not yet available.

For this, there is a script `doc-generate-missing-translations.sh` in the root of the repository. When you add a new file, you just have to create the english version, then run this script.
It will create all  missing translations, putting a sample message inviting the user to read the english version.
